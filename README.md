# Crontab_Scripts
This repo will contain a list of useful crontab scripts for Linux.
Remember, there is a chance these scripts won't work for you, or even break your system.
It is entirely your responsibility to test these scripts in a non-production environtment prior to deploying them into a real production system.

Be smart, and good luck!
